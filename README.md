# Project Description 
This project involves the development of an advanced data-driven inventory management and optimization system for Fossil Watch Company. The primary goal was to address inefficiencies in inventory control, supply chain management, and sales forecasting, which contributed to a staggering $20 billion loss in 2017. By leveraging data visualization, advanced analytics, and inventory modeling techniques, this dashboard empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions to reduce costs, optimize stock levels, and enhance operational efficiency.

# Business Problem 
Fossil faced significant losses due to:

Overstocking and Understocking: Inefficient inventory allocation led to surplus stock for slow-moving items and stockouts for high-demand products.
Inadequate Demand Forecasting: A lack of precise forecasting caused mismatched supply and demand.
Low Sell-Through Rates: Products failed to convert inventory into sales efficiently, creating significant leftover stock.
Inefficient Reordering Mechanisms: Mismanagement of reorder points increased costs and exacerbated inventory imbalances.

# KPI Questions,  insights deriven and solution 
## 1. How does the monthly Sell-In compare to the FLAG100 (threshold inventory value) trend?
### Insight:
Observed an increasing sell-in trend from January (15.2bn) to December (29.3bn), with notable dips in June and August, indicating seasonality in product demand.
The FLAG100 threshold showed an inconsistent trend, peaking during Q4, emphasizing the need for realignment of inventory thresholds with actual demand.
### Solution:
Introduced seasonality-based forecasting to adjust inventory levels dynamically and align with quarterly demand patterns.
## 2. What are the differences between Sell-In and Sell-Out values across different sales channels?
### Insight:
The sell-in value significantly exceeded the sell-out value across most channels, particularly in Channel 3, highlighting overstocking issues.
### Solution:
Optimized stock allocation by integrating sell-out data into the replenishment model. Focused on redistributing inventory from oversaturated channels to underperforming ones.
## 3. Which SKUs exhibit misaligned reorder points and stock coverage issues?
### Insight:
Products like "HALRRONARLE" and "ARTILANDARTI" showed excess on-hand inventory compared to their reorder points, resulting in inefficient use of capital.
Negative stock coverage days for SKUs like "SHLMARXGRAH" and "AMUSHIEARLE" revealed critical overstocking issues.
### Solution:
Implemented dynamic reorder point calculations based on real-time inventory movement, lead times, and sell-through rates.
## 4. What is the leftover inventory at the end of the year?
### Insight:
A total leftover inventory value of 160bn was identified, indicating a significant proportion of unsold products.
### Solution:
Introduced clearance sales for slow-moving SKUs and demand-based production scheduling to minimize leftover inventory.
## 5. What are the stock coverage trends, and how can they be improved?
### Insight:
SKUs with the lowest stock coverage days were concentrated among underperforming product lines, resulting in sunk costs.
### Solution:
Reduced manufacturing rates for poorly performing SKUs and reallocated marketing budgets to promote high-demand products.

# Conclusion 
The dashboard effectively addresses Fossil's inventory challenges by providing actionable insights into stock levels, sales trends, and reorder points. With these tools:

Overstocking and understocking issues were mitigated, ensuring optimal capital utilization.
Inventory thresholds were aligned with seasonal demand trends, improving sales conversion rates.
Slow-moving inventory was reduced through targeted clearance strategies.
This data-driven approach equips Fossil with the tools to reduce operational inefficiencies, enhance inventory management practices, and potentially recover from financial losses experienced in previous years.
